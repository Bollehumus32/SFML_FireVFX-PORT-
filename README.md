## THE ORIGINAL GITHUB PAGE IS HERE: https://github.com/kadir014/pygame-vfx ##

This is a terrible port for SFML C++ of Kadir's pygame fire vfx.
The calculations and the ideas are all his and I do not take claim to any of these. This is simply a remake in C++, 
as I was curious how the framerate would differ on C++ compared to python.

So go check out the original GitHub page and dont pay mine any mind.
